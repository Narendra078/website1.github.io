				<p class="pt-5 pb-5" style="letter-spacing: 1px; font-size: 17px;">What's up, there. I'm A.Narendra Verma from odisha studying in Chennai at SRM University.
					Writing an articales is hard for me, but making up design is fun. This is not my first website which i was created but this is my website where i can put my projects, blogs, certificates  and every things i can.   <br>
					Nothing brings me more pleasure than making something out of nothing. Even when the result are far from my ideal expectations.
					<br><br>
					Apart from all these, I enjoy watching, listening and reading Mythology stories and also playing Chess.
					My main hobby is listening music, music is an emotion to me which i able to connect with every situation.
